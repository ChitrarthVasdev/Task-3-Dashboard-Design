## üõ†Ô∏è Data Preparation Steps in Power BI

### 1. Load the Data
- Open Power BI Desktop
- Go to `Home ‚Üí Get Data ‚Üí Text/CSV`
- Select `Product_Sales.csv` and click **Load**

---

### 2. Add Simulated Date Column (`CallDate`)
Since the original dataset had no timestamp, a simulated `CallDate` was added for time-series analysis.

#### ‚û§ Open Power Query Editor
- Click `Transform Data` from the Home tab

#### ‚û§ Add Index Column
- Go to `Add Column ‚Üí Index Column ‚Üí From 0`

#### ‚û§ Add Custom Column
- Go to `Add Column ‚Üí Custom Column`
- Name it `CallDate` and use the following formula:
  
 datetime(2024, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0) + #duration(Number.Mod([Index], 365), 0, 0, 0) 


#### ‚û§ Format the Column
- Change the CallDate column‚Äôs type to Date

#### ‚û§ Remove Index Column 
- Right-click the index column ‚Üí Remove

#### ‚û§ Click Close & Apply to save changes

## üìä Dashboard Components

| **Component**       | **Description**                                           |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **KPI Cards**        | Display `Total Calls`, `PickedUp %`, `Total Products Sold`, `Conversion Rate`, and `Avg Call Duration` |
| **Line Chart**       | Time series of product sales (`CallDate` vs `Products Sold`) |
| **Bar Chart**        | `Agent_Name` vs `Total Products Sold` to show agent performance |
| **Pie/Donut Chart**  | Distribution of `Picked` vs `Missed` calls                |
| **Table**            | Detailed `Agent-wise` performance summary                |

## üõ†Ô∏è DAX Measures Used

1) Total Calls = COUNT('Product_Sales (2)'[CallID])

2)PickedUp Calls = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNT('Product_Sales (2)'[CallID]),
    FILTER('Product_Sales (2)', 'Product_Sales (2)'[PickedUp] = 1)
)

3) PickedUp % = 
DIVIDE([PickedUp Calls], [Total Calls], 0)

4) Total Products Sold = 
SUM('Product_Sales (2)'[ProductSold])

5) Conversion Rate = 
DIVIDE([Total Products Sold], [PickedUp Calls], 0)

6) Avg Call Duration (mins) = 
AVERAGE('Product_Sales (2)'[Duration]) / 60


## üß© Interactivity Features

- **Drill-down**: Enabled in charts for deeper insights
- **Sync Filters**: Maintain consistent filtering across visuals

## üé® Design Highlights

- Clean and intuitive layout with consistent color theme (default)
- Title and section headers for clarity
- Visual hierarchy to guide stakeholder attention
- Responsive layout using grid alignment

## üìù Key Insights

- Majority of calls are picked up, but conversion rate remains below 20%
- Certain agents have high call volume but lower sales performance
- Sales peak in Q4 (October‚ÄìDecember)
- Shorter calls (<2 minutes) often result in fewer conversions
